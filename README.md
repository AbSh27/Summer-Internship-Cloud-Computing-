# Summer-Internship-Cloud-Computing-
Overview

This repository documents the work completed during my Summer Internship in the domain of Cloud Computing. The internship focused on building hands-on skills in cloud storage, monitoring, multi-cloud architectures, and cloud security.
The tasks were carried out using major cloud service providers like AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ensuring exposure to real-world multi-cloud environments.

Internship Tasks
Task 1: Create and Configure Cloud Storage
Set up cloud storage using AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
Configured buckets with proper naming conventions, permissions, and access policies.
Enabled versioning and lifecycle management for efficient storage utilization.
Tested upload/download operations for validation.

Task 2: Monitoring a Cloud-Based Application
Implemented AWS CloudWatch and Google Cloud Monitoring for real-time application insights.
Set up metrics, logs, and dashboards to monitor system performance.
Configured alerts and notifications for resource utilization and failures.
Ensured monitoring of latency, error rates, and availability.

Task 3: Multi-Cloud Architecture
Designed a multi-cloud architecture distributing components across AWS and GCP.
Frontend: React application hosted on AWS S3 + CloudFront.
Backend: Node.js API deployed on Google Cloud Run.
Database: PostgreSQL hosted on AWS RDS.
File Storage: User uploads stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
Ensured interoperability between cloud platforms for seamless data flow.

Task 4: Cloud Security
Implemented Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for secure access control.
Configured encryption mechanisms (KMS, at-rest, and in-transit encryption).
Applied bucket policies and firewall rules for storage and services.
Audited access logs for compliance and security monitoring.


Skills Gained
Proficiency in AWS (S3, RDS, CloudFront, CloudWatch) and Google Cloud (Cloud Run, GCS, Monitoring).
Designing and deploying multi-cloud solutions.
Implementing cloud-native monitoring and alerting.
Applying best practices for cloud security and compliance.


Conclusion
This internship provided practical exposure to real-world cloud computing challenges such as storage management, monitoring, security, and multi-cloud integration. It strengthened my understanding of modern cloud infrastructures and enhanced my ability to design scalable, secure, and resilient cloud solutions.
